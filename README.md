# miniskim - A mini Scheme Interpreter

A mini Scheme interpreter implemented in C.

This project is inspired by the following;

 * [Lispy from Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/lispy.html): This article got me into developing this one. LISP implementation in Python, very well written. Highly recommended.
 * [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp)
 * Mini-Scheme version 0.85
